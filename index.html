			<h2>A Hackathon for All</h2>
			<p>
				Hornet Hacks is a collaborative initiative organized by the Carlsen Center for Innovation & Entrepreneurship, ACM Sac State and the college of ECS at Sac State to foster innovation and exploration in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
				<br><br>
				This competitive event is designed to bring together students with a passion for AI, encouraging them to develop and innovate in two main categories: AI models and AI service-oriented applications. 
				Participants have the flexibility to focus on one category or integrate both into their projects. The competition is open to teams with a minimum of one member and a maximum of 5, allowing for 
				individual participation as well as collaborative team efforts. Each team will have the opportunity to showcase their projects to a panel of judges, who will evaluate them based on innovation, applicability, technical proficiency, and potential impact.
				<br><br>
				This event aims to provide a platform for students to demonstrate their skills, creativity, and vision in AI, while also promoting a culture of learning and knowledge-sharing among peers.
